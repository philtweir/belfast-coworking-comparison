# Belfast Coworking Comparison [DRAFT]
This is a handy reference showing the various coworking spaces in Belfast, to help independent workers shop around. To get listed, a coworking space must publicly (online) advertise a standard desk price (with max 3 month lock-in), or an hourly rental rate, for individual users. Please help us complete and/or correct our chart, through pull requests to the repo behind this. It uses Github pages, so accepted PRs will change this page automatically.
